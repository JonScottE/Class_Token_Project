I -THINK- funDrop.sol (if that's what we're using for a name?!?!?!) is actually the right start?  I'm not sure if we need to inherit the "ERC20Mintable" open zepplin, if we're including our own mint function???  And the mint function probably needs to be improved...

YOOOOOOOO!!!! Check out "SelectWinner.sol" it's almost perfect already!!! But we need to adjust the end of the code so it's a percent of the whole, instead of a static number or single number.

Feel free to mess around and add your own.
