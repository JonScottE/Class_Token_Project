I -THINK- funDrop.sol (if that's what we're using for a name?!?!?!) is actually the right start?  I'm not sure if we need to inherit the "ERC20Mintable" open zepplin, if we're including our own mint function???  And the mint function probably needs to be improved...
</br></br>
YOOOOOOOO!!!! Check out "SelectWinner.sol" it's almost perfect already!!!
</br></br>
Nothing crazy so far... just starting to load some kind of code to jumpstart off of...  I'm actually not sure if the "Internet version" of the code, is just what's included in the open zepplin imports we're doing anyway...  QUESTION for Carl or Lester</br></br></br>
Feel free to mess around and add your own.
