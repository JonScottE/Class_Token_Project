I -THINK- funDrop.sol (if that's what we're using for a name?!?!?!) is actually the right start?  I'm not sure if we need to inherit the "ERC20Mintable" open zepplin, if we're including our own mint function???  And the mint function probably needs to be improved...

YOOOOOOOO!!!! Check out "SelectWinner.sol" it's almost perfect already!!!

Feel free to mess around and add your own.
