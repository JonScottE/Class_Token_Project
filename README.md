I just created SimpleFundRaiserExplained.sol it was really helpful, and goes through step by step what is doing what in a simple fundraising contract.</br>
I think we just need to make the constructor more robust, and add more functions :-)

Writing a smart contract
Smart Contracts are one of the important parts of the blockchain. So if you are creating an ERC20 token, then you should give more importance while writing smart contracts. When it comes to the ERC20 smart contract, there are six essential functions. Such as
totalSupply
balanceOf
allowance
transfer
approve
transferFrom
These six functions play an important role while making an ERC20 token.
</br>the latest and cutting-edge features in their ERC20 token development service.
Such as
ERC20 Contact generation
Setting Initial Supply
Setting No of Issues
Setting Fractions
Deploy Contracts
Mintable
Burnable
Pausable
Generate Tokens
Validate Contract
High-end security features</br>
</br></br></br>
I -THINK- funDrop.sol (if that's what we're using for a name?!?!?!) is actually the right start?  I'm not sure if we need to inherit the "ERC20Mintable" open zepplin, if we're including our own mint function???  And the mint function probably needs to be improved...
</br></br>
YOOOOOOOO!!!! Check out "SelectWinner.sol" it's almost perfect already!!! But we need to adjust the end of the code so it's a percent of the whole, instead of a static number or single number.

Understanding the Smart Contract</br></br>
Before moving on to the code letâ€™s understand exactly how our smart contract gonna work on a basic level.</br>
The Smart Contract operates in the following way:</br>
The admin will Start a Campaign or a Project for fundraising with a Specific Goal and Deadline.</br>
Contributors will contribute to that project by sending the required Tokens(in this case ether).</br>
The Admin will create a Spending Request every time he wants to use any amount from those funds</br>
The Contributors will vote for that Spending Request.</br>
If more than 50% of the total contributors vote for that request then the admin will get permission to use the amount mentioned in the Spending Request</br>
The contributors can withdraw their ether if the required amount(Goal) was not raised within the Deadline.</br>
Note: A spending request can only be created when the Goal is reached.</br>
